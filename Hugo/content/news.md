### Received Proposals - 26/09/2016 (last update: 01/10/2016)

First proposals for the Lightning Talks session start to arrive. Please, do not hesitate to send a brief intro of your 5 minutes lightning talk. Below, you have the received proposals up to date:

* *Translating OCL to NoSQL query languages*, by Gwendal Daniel
  * The need to store and manipulate large volume of (unstructured) data has led to the development of several NoSQL databases for better scalability. While the mapping of conceptual schemas to relational databases is a well-studied field of research, there are only few solutions that target conceptual modeling for NoSQL databases and none of them deal with the mapping of business rules and constraints in the conceptual schema. In this presentation we introduce UMLtoGraphDB, a PIM-to-PSM approach that translates UML/OCL conceptual schemas into graph databases and graph queries via an intermediate Graph metamodel. UMLtoGraphDB allows designers to quickly generate Java code to manipulate concepts and check constraints defined in the conceptual schema. This translation is also used to improve the execution time and memory consumption of executing OCL constraints on models stored in NoSQL model persistence frameworks such as NeoEMF.
* *A Formal Methods Environment for OCL: HOL-OCL 2.0*, by Burkhart Wolff, Achim D. Brucker and Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Tuong
  * We present HOL-OCL 2.0, a semantically well-founded UML/OCL modelling environment that is centred around a interactive theorem prover for OCL 2.x. While it shares many concepts with HOL-OCL 1.0, it is a complete rewrite that, on the one hand, supports the latest OCL standard (including a four-valued logic) and, on the other hand, brings all the latest features of the Isabelle architecture to OCL (IDE, document generation, advanced proof procedures). The implementation of HOL-0CL 2.0 is based on a reflective approach that can be understood as a formal meta-modelling approach.
* *Making OCL Collection Operations More Deterministic with Restricting Equations*, by Martin Gogolla and Frank Hilken
  * OCL provides four collection kinds, i.e., sets, bags, ordered sets, and sequences, and offers conversion operations between them: asBag, asOrd(eredSet), asSeq(uence) and asSet. OCL says nearly nothing about the relationship between these operations and leaves much freedom to OCL implementors. The talk wants to raise the question whether it would be desirable to restrict these operations by equations like SET->asBag()->asSeq()=SET->asSeq() or BAG->asSet()->asOrd()=BAG->asOrd().
* *The importance of Opposites*, by Edward D. Willink
  * The opposite navigability of all relationships in OCL is often overlooked, yet it is the cornerstone upon which a fully modelled transformation language such as QVTr can be built.
* *On the need for OCL benchmarks and repository*, by Jordi Cabot and Martin Gogolla.
  * In this talk we will argue that the OCL community needs a set of well-accepted benchmarks that can help us evaluate, test and compare OCL-related tools and a shared repository where these benchmarks (and many other examples of OCL expressions) are publicly stored for everybody to use and see. We believe this is a key requirement to mature and grow the research around OCL and other textual languages.

### Lightning Talks (CfP) - 23/09/2016 

This year, the OCL workshop will host an open session at the end of the day where anybody will have the opportunity to talk about whatever they want for five minutes. No formal presubmission is required. Just send an email to [ocl16@easychair.org](ocl16@easychair.org) with the title and one paragraph description of what you'd like to talk about for organisational purposes.
 
As long as it's related to the topics of the workshop, you can talk about whatever you want: present a new tool, discuss early ideas, propose discussion topics, rant about OCL, etc. Our goal is to foster exchanges among the community that go beyond the formal presentation of the workshop papers. It's up to you to make this session exciting.

### Program Including Accepted Paper Preprints - 12/09/2016

The program of the workshop is now available, including a pre-proceedings PDF version of the accepted papers. You can download them [here](/2016/program.html).
